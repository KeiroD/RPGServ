# RPGServ
RPGServ for Anope.

# Installation Process

You want to drop the `rpgserv` folder into `src/modules` for Anope. Or simply extract the contents of `rpgserv` into `src/modules` instead of plopping the folder into `src/modules`.

Either way, it works just the same.

# RPGServ Configuration

To have RPGServ work, you need to have an `rpgserv.conf` in the `conf` folder for Services so that it can automatically come online with Services when it's started.

A sample `rpgserv.conf` has been provided. Adapt as you see fit.
